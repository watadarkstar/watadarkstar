# > I'm  Adrian 👨🏻‍💻⚛️

I’m an experienced Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, specializing in Front-End Engineering, with a focus on **React**, **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and **GraphQL**. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to develop web and mobile apps for a range of reputable companies, including:

- **Patio** (Stanford)  
- **Flyreel** (Google-backed)  
- **Penta Medical** (YC S18)  
- **Fitbit**  
- **Vanco**  
- **Wave Accounting**  
- **Cineplex**  
- **Kik**  
- **Mountain Equipment Co-op**  
- **Ligonier Ministries**  
- *And many more...*

Beyond individual projects, I’m also an active open source contributor to the **React**, **React Native**, and **React Native IDE** communities. I enjoy diving deep into these ecosystems and contributing enhancements that help other developers build better products.
